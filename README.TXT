*** Magic Maze and a Half ***

The 1.4.x (and subsequent 1.5.x) versions of 
Magic Maze is dubbed "Magic Maze and a Half", 
and is a port of MM to the language Ruby using SDL. 

It does not aim to introduce major new gameplay changes,
but some upgrades and improvements will rear their heads.

Hopefully there will be a playable version by the time
of the 10 year anniversary of the development start of
the original Turbo Pascal version, which began in
November 1994.

*** Magic Maze: Two Tunnels ***

Please forgive the poor Lord of the Rings pun.
The 1.9.x and subsequent 2.x versions of Magic Maze is
dubbed "MM: Two Tunnels" and is a more long-term plan
to change gameplay more drastically. 

This is the experimental playground I'm setting up for
myself, and is less likely to show up this side of the
Apocolypse.
