Coming to level 3, from level 2.

Was firing lowest attack spell (lightning) while exiting level 2. 
Suddenly I could no longer fire lightning. All others were OK, just not lightning.
Tried to restart level, same problem.

Looks like the list of active spells aren't being emptied when we change levels.

Same as from 2004-10-27?

Level 3 - suddenly lowest missile spell stops working.
Upon exit, I get :
