TO DO
- ideas, suggestions, plans etc for Magic Maze.


MISSING FROM OLD MAGIC MAZE

* Default background tiles differ to show motion. DONE.
* Lookahead spell
* Map spell
* End game sequence
* Load/save game
* Train level
	



MOVEMENT

* fine-grained movement
  - slide toward opening when crashing into single blocks

* mouse-aim

* transform sprite (rotate) along movement/aim direction.


GAMEPLAY

* Boss end-game
- Luciper moving left and right, firing off monsters.
- Control wizard at bottom, shooting spells upwards.

* Dynamic GOO
- The goo left by dead monsters have effects:
-- Green  - Sticky   - 50% chance of movement failing (rotation and direction)
-- Red    - Yucky    - 80% chance of loosing health point.
-- Blue   - Slippery - 60% chance of continuing a directional movement impulse.
-- Yellow - Stinky   - 40% chance of random rotational movement?


* enemies shoot back
  - using spells

* enemy energy and stamina affecting their decisions

* different modes of enemy perception (some smell, some see, some hear)
  - change when/how they react to the player
  - store events they can access (sound of player within range, smell of player within range etc)

* triggers
  - on positions (such as hints about key use before hitting doors)
  - on events (specific monsters attacked)

* Auto-play
- Demo recording/replay?

* Map editor
- Educational; sharing maps?


MULTIPLAYER

* several players on one machine
  - Gauntlet style?
  - 4 tiled gameviews?
  - coop/deathmatch?

* Internet play
  - Separate game server which OKs requests
    ("Can I move here? Can I shoot?") and
    and distributes diffs of the gameplay
    (Change tile X,Y from A to B etc)



JOYSTICK SUPPORT
- should be easy, since SDL already provides it.

- In Linux on my home system, as root:
        modprobe emu10k1-gp
        modprobe analog
        modprobe joydev
        chmod a+rx /dev/input/js0
