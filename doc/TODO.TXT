TO DO
- ideas, suggestions, plans etc for Magic Maze.



MOVEMENT

* fine-grained movement
  - slide toward opening when crashing into single blocks

* mouse-aim

* transform sprite (rotate) along movement/aim direction.


GAMEPLAY

* enemies shoot back
  - using spells

* enemy energy and stamina affecting their decisions

* different modes of enemy perception (some smell, some see, some hear)
  - change when/how they react to the player


MULTIPLAYER

* several players on one machine
  - Gauntlet style?
  - 4 tiled gameviews?
  - coop/deathmatch?

* Internet play
  - Separate game server which OKs requests
    ("Can I move here? Can I shoot?") and
    and distributes diffs of the gameplay
    (Change tile X,Y from A to B etc)
