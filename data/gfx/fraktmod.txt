My fonts are all free.  You can use them for personal or commercial projects,
and I ask for no money.  I would, however, love to hear from you.  If you use
my fonts for something please e-mail me letting me know how you used it.  Send
me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work. You are under
no obligation to do this, I just like to see how my fonts get used.

A license.txt file should have been included with this font, explaining the
license under which it is made available. You can also read it at:

About the font:

Old German fraktur letterforms done with a modern look.  I tried to
maintain the look of fraktur blackletter but give it a uniform
stroke weight and an almost sans-serif look.
