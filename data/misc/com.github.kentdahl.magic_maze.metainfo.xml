  <summary>rescue the maiden while avoiding the monsters</summary>
  <description>
    <p>This is a simple game where you are a wizard searching the evil
    demon's tower to try and rescue the beautiful maiden.  Inspired by
    Gauntlet II, your goal is to avoid/kill the monsters while trying
    to find the exit and, eventually, the big boss who is holding your
    girlfriend captive.  Includes support for playing in full-screen
    and with a joystick.</p>
